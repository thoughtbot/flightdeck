# Flightdeck

[Terraform] modules for rapidly building production-grade Kubernetes clusters
with built-in support for SRE best practices.

These modules are provided by thoughtbot. These are the modules we use when
following SRE practices for our clients. We can help you scale your application,
improve stability, and increase the rate of defect-free deployments. You can
learn more on the [thoughtbot website].
